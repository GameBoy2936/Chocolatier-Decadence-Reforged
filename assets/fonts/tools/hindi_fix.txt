# Hindi (Devanagari) Spacing Fixes

# Aggressively pull the next character back into the "Short I" curve
# Try values between -0.6em and -0.9em until the top bar connects perfectly.
# (Assuming the natural width is roughly 0.6em, -0.6em makes it 0 width. 
#  Going lower, like -0.7em, forces an overlap).
U+093F -0.65em

# Ensure the dot (Anusvara) sits exactly on top of the previous char
# Subtracting 1.0em usually centers it over the previous character 
# (assuming the previous char was about 1em wide).
U+0902 -1.0em

# Clean up other marks
U+093C -0.6em # Nukta
U+094D -0.6em # Virama
